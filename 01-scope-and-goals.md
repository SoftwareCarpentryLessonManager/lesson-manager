This is a follow-up on the [post by Raniere](http://blog.rgaiacs.com/2014/07/02/import_lesson_is_possible.html).
I agree on a lot of it, including the fact that we should build on top on versioning systems, use HTML, that we can use a JSON format for metadata, …
In this document I detail some comments and additional reflections that I find important for the project.

## Scope: installing lessons or having a lesson platform

The original formulation of the project is to be able to choose and import lessons when preparing for a bootcamp.
However, once we start describing lessons, much more can be done, such as:
- giving an overview of the graph of lessons (when preparing, when you're a new instructor, …)
- using the graph to make it possible for learners to know what they can do/explore after the bootcamp
- using the graph to explicitely state the requirements (pre-conditions) to attend a bootcamp (e.g., installation can be pre-condition for novice bootcamp) (e.g., novice shell lesson may be a precondition for a not-totally-novice bootcamp)
- supporting self-learners (out of bootcamps) and past learners that want to stay up to date
